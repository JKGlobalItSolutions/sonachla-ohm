          <strong>Online Travel Agencies (OTA):</strong> Being present on all the major OTA's
          (For eg: Goibibo, MMT, Sonachala.com etc.) is very important as almost everyone is present on the OTA whether it’s your competitors or customers.

          <strong>Having your Hotel's website:</strong> Your own website is a place where you can
          showcase any content you like and that you think is necessary to drive in more customers. The most important thing to have with a website is a booking engine and a payment gateway without which one would not be able to make bookings or do payment online.

      </p>

      <ul className="mb-4 ps-3">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Search engines like Google use certain algorithms
          to rank various websites and content present on the internet, and SEO is all about making your website search engine friendly and
          making your hotel website rank at the top whenever a search is made related to hotels or any related keywords.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Social Media Optimization (SMO):</strong> Almost 40-50% of guests take suggestions from others
          before choosing a hotel to stay in. The goal of SMO is to strategically create interesting online content, ranging from well-written
          text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourage and entice people to engage with a website and then share this content,
          via its web link, with their social media contacts and friends.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5 className="fw-semibold mb-3">Real Time Inventory:</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This includes updating inventory (no. of rooms available) on real-time which in reality is not possible manually as it is a
        time-consuming work and for that, we would suggest having a channel manager. We provide the same at a very nominal price,
        if hotel billing software (optional).
